+ get a tiny rps dataset that reaches 2045 (rps_tiny)
project +loads, -equipment costs and +fuel costs to 2050

+ convert future fuel costs from nominal to real based on inflation used in HECO IRP reports (maybe 2.5%/year according to p. K-97 of http://www.hawaiianelectric.com/vcmcontent/IntegratedResource/IRP/PDF/IRP-2013-App-K-Supply-Side-Resource-Assessment-062813-Filed.pdf)

+ check that connection cable costs are not overstated by 1000 for wind projects

- eventually: use different capital costs for generator projects each year and account for inflation. For now, we assume capital costs for all technologies are constant in real terms.

project ev adoption to 2050 (use /Users/matthias/Dropbox/Research/Shared/Switch-Hawaii/data/HECO IRP Report/IRP-2013-App-E-Quantifying-the-Scenarios-062813-Filed.pdf and something more aggressive)

use RPS module
create demand response module that models demand response as simple shiftable load
+ create battery module that models standard storage
(dr and batteries are like kauai model)
create pumped_hydro model that models wilson pumped hydro project

+get solve.py to accept arguments, e.g., names of elements to add:
	ph, dr, ev, biofuel yes/no, rps yes/no, high_fuel/low_fuel costs?, low_battery/high_battery costs?, +low_load/high_load?, wind?
+Then it should add the appropriate modules and set the tag for output files.

create a full rps time_sample (rps)
create a mini rps time_sample (rps_mini), which only covers even months and even hours

build a scenario tree:
*no_rps	no_ph	no_dr	no_ev

rps	no_ph	no_dr	no_ev
		dr	no_ev
			ev
	
	ph	no_dr	no_ev
		dr	no_ev
*			ev
