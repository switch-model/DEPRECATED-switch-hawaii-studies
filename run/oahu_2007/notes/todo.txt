TODO:

data:
? use part-load heat rates in switch
? get reserves code into switch repository
? get QLPU ratings for existing plants
? get minimum loads for new and existing plants
? get heat rate curves for new plants
? get true-up and validation working

mark must-run plants

experiments:
iterate with michael roberts' demand function
move to future-planning context
show optimal plan, curtailment and cost with/without demand response

- adapt switch to allow fuel costs by project and date
- adapt switch to allow plants to use a power sales price (by hour) instead of a fuel cost.

x tabulate heat rates for heco plants (fuel_use.tab created from Switch-Hawaii/data/Plant Heat Rates HECO/Appendix A Production Cost Database for Baseline system 2.xlsx)


x extract existing plant details in suitable format for new switch - (edit "Switch-Hawaii/pyomo/data/get_scenario_data.py")
x add code to create heat rate curve files for new and existing plants (when part load heat rates are in switch)

- forced outage rates (use Paritosh's data for now, later compare to Table 3 of http://puc.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Adequacy-of-Supply-HECO-2015.pdf (2010-14))

find minimum commit (baseload status and maintenance schedules) for heco plants in past
http://puc.hawaii.gov/reports/energy-reports/adequacy-of-supply/
also mentioned in GE RPS roadmap study 2015

- find heco retirements and capacity additions (look through IRP and adequacy reports) (already in Paritosh's data from EIA)
http://puc.hawaii.gov/reports/energy-reports/adequacy-of-supply/
http://www.hawaiianelectric.com/heco/Clean-Energy/Integrated-Resource-Planning/Hawaiian-Electric-Company-IRP-Reports-and-PUC-Documents

- get data on hourly power from as-available IPPs (????)

x find fuel cost data (ask Michael Roberts?)

- calculate capacity factors for existing wind farms (see "kahuku historical wind data sources.txt" and e-mails to Karl and Michael about historical RE data; put in as baseload 10 MW for now)

- find interruptible load data used for reserve planning in past (treat as zero for now)

code:
finance / discounting / weights / objective (or switch to Josiah's)
(above may be ignorable for historical HECO model)

create a launcher function that imports all the relevant modules (i.e., don't import the launcher)
   (or switch to Josiah's)

to switch to Josiah's code base:
- agree on indexing and expressions for project_build and project_dispatch
- add load zones
- maybe add balancing areas
- merge project_commitment
- merge project_fuel
- add commitment and dispatch slack variables to support reserves
