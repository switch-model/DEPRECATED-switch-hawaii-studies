# revised by Matthias 2015-09-08, altering the table structure.
# note: all of this code should be streamlined and migrated into "import_data.py"

1. The fuel_costs table was created using the script :

CREATE TABLE fuel_costs
(
  load_zone text,
  
year integer,
  
fuel_type text,
  
price_mmbtu double precision,
  
fuel_scen_id integer
)

2. The rows of the table were imported from the csv file named "fuel_prices_heco_irp.csv".
This file was compiled using data from HECO IRP 
(IRP-2013-App-E-Quantifying-the-Scenarios-062813-Filed.pdf) for most of the fuel types present except Coal. The fuel prices for coal have been taken from the AEO2014 report [Annual Energy Outlook 2014 With 
Projections to 2040 - Released April 2014, Appendix A- Table A1 ]. The data from AEO2014 were for the years 2020, 2014,2020,2040

-- fuel_scen_id=3 is our main fuel price scenario, but it's just calculated as the average of
-- HECO's low (fuel_scen_id=1) and high (fuel_scen_id=2) scenarios.
-- Somehow the data for fuel_scen_id=3 for Biocrude on Hawaii (island) was inserted as Biodiesel,
-- making 2 Biodiesel records and no Biocrude records.
-- Also, it doesn't make much sense to have fuel scenario 3 equal to the 
-- average of 1 and 2 before
-- 2034 and then follow the same exponential growth trajectory afterward.
-- So we delete all the records for fuel_scen_id=3 and reconstruct them.
