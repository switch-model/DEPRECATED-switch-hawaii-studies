1. The fuel_costs table was created using the script :

CREATE TABLE fuel_costs
(
  load_zone text,
  
year integer,
  
fuel_type text,
  
price_mmbtu double precision,
  
fuel_scen_id integer
)

2. The rows of the table were imported from the csv file named "fuel_prices_heco_irp.csv".
This file was compiled using data from HECO IRP 
(IRP-2013-App-E-Quantifying-the-Scenarios-062813-Filed.pdf) for most of the fuel types present except Coal. The fuel prices for coal have been taken from the AEO2014 report [Annual Energy Outlook 2014 With 
Projections to 2040 - Released April 2014, Appendix A- Table A1 ]. The data from AEO2014 were for the years 2020, 2014,2020,2040
